Boswell Company
Cordially Invites You

I invite my friends and loyal eBlast members of Boswell Company to visit me in beautiful Atlanta this fall for a private tour of our olive groves and enjoy exclusive tastings of our delicious dipping and cooking oils harvested at the peak of the season.
We look forward to seeing you!
